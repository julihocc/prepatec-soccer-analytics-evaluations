# AI Manifesto: Agent-Powered Educational Assessment System

## Purpose and Philosophy

This manifesto documents our approach to integrating AI agents and technologies in the "Ciencia de Datos Aplicada al Fútbol" educational assessment system. We believe in **transparent, ethical, and pedagogically-sound use of AI** to enhance educational outcomes while preserving academic integrity.

## Core AI Principles

### 1. Transparency First
- All AI-assisted development is documented and traceable
- Changes made by AI agents include clear attribution
- Human oversight remains paramount for all educational content decisions
- AI suggestions are reviewed and validated before implementation

### 2. Educational Integrity
- AI tools enhance the learning process, never replace human judgment
- Question banks and assessments maintain their pedagogical value
- AI assists in format conversion and technical tasks, not content creation
- Academic standards and evaluation criteria remain human-defined

### 3. Security and Privacy
- Sensitive educational material is protected from unauthorized AI model training
- Confidential content (answer keys, solutions) is handled with appropriate security measures
- AI interactions respect the private nature of the academic repository
- No sensitive data is exposed to external AI services without explicit authorization

## AI Technologies in Use

### Primary AI Agents

#### Claude Code (Anthropic)
- **Role**: Development assistant and code refactoring agent
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Code analysis and architectural understanding
  - Automated refactoring of Python modules
  - Documentation generation and maintenance
  - Testing and validation guidance
- **Usage Pattern**: Interactive development sessions with human oversight
- **Integration Points**: 
  - CLI tool development (`evaluaciones/` package)
  - txttoqti library integration
  - Documentation creation (CLAUDE.md, this manifesto)

#### GitHub Copilot (if in use)
- **Role**: Code completion and suggestion assistant
- **Guidelines**: Follow patterns defined in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Constraints**: Never suggest modifications to educational content or answer keys
- **Focus Areas**: Boilerplate code, error handling, CLI interface improvements

### Supporting AI Technologies

#### txttoqti Library Integration
- **External AI Component**: txttoqti v0.3.0 with educational extensions
- **Function**: Automated question format detection and QTI conversion
- **AI Features**:
  - Smart question parsing using pattern recognition
  - Automatic format validation
  - Educational content structure detection
- **Human Oversight**: All conversions are validated before use

#### Automated Validation Systems
- **Purpose**: Question format compliance checking
- **AI Elements**: Pattern matching and format validation
- **Implementation**: `evaluaciones/validator.py` with txttoqti integration
- **Safeguards**: Human review of validation results

## Development Workflows with AI

### Code Refactoring Process
1. **AI Analysis**: Agent analyzes existing codebase architecture
2. **Plan Generation**: AI proposes refactoring strategy with todo tracking
3. **Implementation**: Step-by-step implementation with continuous validation
4. **Human Review**: All changes reviewed for correctness and security
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before deployment

### Documentation Generation
1. **Codebase Analysis**: AI examines project structure and dependencies
2. **Content Creation**: Generate technical documentation (CLAUDE.md, API docs)
3. **Review Cycle**: Human validation of accuracy and completeness
4. **Maintenance**: Ongoing updates as codebase evolves

### Quality Assurance Integration
```bash
# AI-assisted quality checks
black evaluaciones/        # Code formatting
ruff check evaluaciones/   # AI-powered linting
eval-validate --verbose    # Educational content validation
```

## AI Agent Guidelines

### For Development Agents (Claude Code, Copilot)
- **DO**: Assist with technical implementation, code structure, documentation
- **DO**: Suggest improvements to CLI interfaces and error handling
- **DO**: Help with dependency management and integration tasks
- **DON'T**: Modify educational content, answer keys, or evaluation criteria
- **DON'T**: Make changes to confidential material without explicit approval
- **DON'T**: Suggest alterations to academic standards or grading rubrics

### For Educational Content Processing
- **DO**: Validate question format compliance
- **DO**: Convert between technical formats (TXT → QTI)
- **DO**: Check for structural consistency across evaluation blocks
- **DON'T**: Alter question content, correct answers, or difficulty levels
- **DON'T**: Generate new educational material without human creation
- **DON'T**: Make pedagogical judgments about question quality

## Data Governance

### Sensitive Information Classification
- **Public**: Technical architecture, CLI commands, installation instructions
- **Internal**: Code implementation details, architectural decisions
- **Confidential**: Question banks with answers, complete solutions, evaluation rubrics
- **Restricted**: Student data, assessment results, grade distributions

### AI Data Handling Rules
- **Public/Internal**: May be processed by AI agents with appropriate safeguards
- **Confidential**: AI processing only with explicit approval and security measures
- **Restricted**: No AI processing without special authorization and encryption

### Model Training Considerations
- Repository marked as confidential to prevent inadvertent training data inclusion
- Regular review of AI service terms to ensure educational material protection
- Local processing preferred for sensitive operations

## Human-AI Collaboration Model

### Decision Authority
- **AI Agents**: Technical implementation, format validation, documentation generation
- **Human Developers**: Architecture decisions, security policies, educational standards
- **Academic Staff**: Content creation, assessment criteria, pedagogical approaches

### Collaboration Patterns
1. **AI Proposes, Human Disposes**: AI suggests solutions, humans make final decisions
2. **Incremental Validation**: Continuous human oversight during AI-assisted tasks
3. **Domain Expertise**: Humans provide educational context, AI handles technical execution

### Quality Assurance Chain
```
AI Suggestion → Human Review → Implementation → Testing → Validation → Deployment
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Monitoring AI Performance
- Track accuracy of AI-assisted code changes
- Monitor educational content validation effectiveness
- Assess development velocity improvements
- Document lessons learned from AI collaboration

### Feedback Integration

- Updates to this manifesto based on experience
- Refinement of AI usage guidelines
- Enhancement of human-AI collaboration processes

### Evolution Path
- Gradual expansion of AI agent capabilities within defined boundaries
- Integration of new AI technologies that align with educational goals
- Continuous training of human staff on AI collaboration best practices

## Compliance and Ethics

### Academic Integrity
- All AI assistance is documented and transparent
- Educational content creation remains fundamentally human-driven
- Assessment validity is preserved through human oversight
- Student privacy and data protection are maintained

### Technical Ethics
- AI tools are used to enhance, not replace, human expertise
- Bias detection and mitigation in educational content processing
- Transparent documentation of AI decision-making processes
- Regular auditing of AI-human collaboration outcomes

### Legal Compliance
- Adherence to educational technology regulations
- Protection of intellectual property rights
- Compliance with data protection laws
- Respect for licensing terms of AI tools and libraries
